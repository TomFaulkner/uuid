A couple Python scripts to quickly generate UUIDs or fake UUIDs with descriptive names.

# gen_uuid.py Usage:
```
python3 gen_uuid.py x
```
Replace `x` with an integer to get that many UUIDs.

# uuid-replacer.py
```
python uuid-replacer.py DescName x y
```
Replace `DescName` with an exactly eight character string.
Replace `x` with starting fake UUID number.
Replace `y` with how many fake UUIDs you want.
